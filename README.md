Using the Wii remote as a mouse on a computer wrote in Csharp

Note: this code uses the WiimoteLib library, 
which provides a C# interface for connecting 
to and interacting with a Wii Remote. 
Also â€” this code only supports using 
the IR sensor from the Wii Remote to control
the mouse cursor, and does not include support for
any other features or buttons on the Wii Remote.
